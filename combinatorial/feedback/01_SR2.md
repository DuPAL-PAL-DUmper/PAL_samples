# 01_SR2

Sample with a Set-Reset latch implemented with two feedback inputs.

Note that `o18` is just the inversion of `i1`.

`o17`, once triggered, is locked in place by `i2`. To trigger it, both `o18` and `i1` should be low, which should never happen.
But by virtue of feedback delays, it does happen that `i1` comes in a little earlier than `o18` changes, triggering the latch.
