Sample with a Set-Reset latch implemented with feedback inputs.

1. To enable `o18`, set `i1 = 0` and `i2 = 1`
2. You can now set `i2 = 0`. IO18 will stay high.
3. To lower (reset) `o18`, set `i1 = 1` and `i2 = 0`

## Explanation

The PAL will start with `o18 = 0`, and we keep `i1 = 0` and `i2 = 0`.

```
/o18 = o18 * i1 + /o18 * /i2

/o18 = 0 * 0 + 1 * 1
/o18 = 0 + 1 => /o18 = 1
o18 = 0
```

We now set `i2 = 1`

```
/o18 = o18 * i1 + /o18 * /i2

/o18 = 0 * 0 + 1 * 0
/o18 = 0 + 0 => /o18 = 0
o18 = 1
```

`o18` has now gone high, and will keep high even if `i2` goes to 0

```
/o18 = o18 * i1 + /o18 * /i2

/o18 = 1 * 0 + 0 * 1
/o18 = 0 + 0 => /o18 = 0
o18 = 1
```

To reset `o18`, you need `i1 = 1` and `i2 = 0`

```
/o18 = o18 * i1 + /o18 * /i2

/o18 = 1 * 1 + 0 * 1
/o18 = 1 + 0 => /o18 = 1
o18 = 0
```
